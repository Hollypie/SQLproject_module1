## Overview

This project was an experiment with working with SQlite as a database option for a small gaming project I eventually wish to do with C# and Unity. I decided it would be easier to code this in Python first as a demo before attempting a more complicated project in C#. I also attempted some experiements in working with PostgreSQL, some of which can be seen in my python_to_prostgres.py file, something that was eventually abandoned in favor of the SQlite. I also had spent time working pgAdmin4, when I was testing my SQL queries with table creation and CRUD operations. That code formed the basis of my repository.py, schema.py, and seed.py logic.

My project which is in main.py is a leaderboard maintenance program. It generates a leaderboard that the user can view. The user can view the scores in a range of dates, add new game sessions, and delete a player.

I would like the ability to display a leaderboard with my Unity game, so I created this one to demo the organization of my game data for my bigger project.

I separated database connection logic (db.py), schema creation (schema.py), seed data (seed.py), and query operations (repository.py) into separate modules to improve encapsulation, reduce accidental data modification, and make the code easier to maintain and extend for future Unity integration.

SQlite is used to create a database. It's generated by the code in the seed.py/schema.py/db.py The generated database is a file called leaderboard.db, this is where the project data gets stored.

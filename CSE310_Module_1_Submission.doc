      <h3>Selected Module: SQL Relational Databases</h3>
      <h3>Module-Specific Requirements</h3>
      <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse;"><tr><td style="background-color:#e2e3e5; font-weight:bold;">All of these are required</td><td style="background-color:#e2e3e5; font-weight:bold;">Completed?</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color:transparent; font-weight:normal;">You must create a database for your program to use including at least one table to store data into.</td><td style="background-color:#d4edda; font-weight:bold;">Yes</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color:transparent; font-weight:normal;">Your software must demonstrate the ability to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve (or query) data.</td><td style="background-color:#d4edda; font-weight:bold;">Yes</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color:transparent; font-weight:normal;">This module requires more than just creating the database and determining SQL commands.

      <p><strong>What learning strategies worked well in this module and what strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well? How can you improve in the next module?</strong><br>I began with the idea that I would be working with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4 and halfway through I changed to using SQlite because it felt like the correct technology for my project.  I spent a great deal of time at first working on finding and watching tutorials and reading documentations. Many decisions had to be made early on and I ended up having to refactor the structure of my code a couple of times.  At first my main.py was very linear and at the end I reordered all the code to be in a loop so that it would display as a menu.  Also I started with a file called queries that I had saved into variables and exported as a module and my operations functions used those but that got unwieldy very quickly.  I changed it from two files into one called respository and the functions themselves contained the db queries for the CRUD operations. I also had a problem of having a database but not knowing how to give the grader access to it. Where to host my project for grading.  That is what led me to create the SQlite database in the generated file leaderboard.db.  This made demonstrating for a grader easier. All the learning I did for this project, was definitely a process. I think I wasted some time holding onto old code and I should have just scrapped it and started again when I discovered I needed to pursue a different approach. I never found a specific tutorial that demonstrated what I specifically wanted to do. I hope to find better more specific helps for my future modules. I chose the C# and Game framework modules. I was hoping this module would be a start at a back end for the other two modules, maybe. I'm proud of what I accomplished. It was nerve racking at times because I wasn't always sure my approach was the correct one.  I'm grateful to have something to turn in.</p>
